# Getting Started

## Installing and loading R packages

In this section, I will install and load tidyverse and sf packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, sf)
```

# Importing the data

## Importing geospatial data in shapefile format

Utilising sf package to read the Masterplan subzone boundary (2014) data in shapefile format.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer="MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

Importing polyline feature data in shapefile format

```{r}
cyclingpath = st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "CyclingPathGazette")
```

## Importing GIS data in kml format

This section uses sf package to read Pre-Schools location data in kml format.

```{r}
preschool = st_read("data/geospatial/preschools-location.kml")
```

## Checking contents of Simple Feature Dataframes

To retrieve and view basic feature information of the Masterplan subzone boundary (2014) layer, the following code chunk is used.

```{r}
st_geometry(mpsz)
```

To further view associated attribute information in the dataframe, *glimpse()* from <code>dplyr</code> package and *head()* from Base R can be used below.

```{r}
glimpse(mpsz)
```

```{r}
head(mpsz, n=5)
```

## Plotting the geospatial data

```{r}
plot(mpsz)
```

::: callout-note
Default plot of an sf object is multi-plot of all attributes
:::

To plot only the geometry to view the subzone boundary:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(mpsz))
```

To plot specific attributes for quick viewing:

```{r}
plot(mpsz["PLN_AREA_N"])
```

# Working with projection

To view CRS of <code>mpsz</code> or any given geospatial layer,

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz)
```

To set new CRS

```{r}
mpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)
```

To check if the new CRS has been updated to EPSG3414,

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz3414)
```

When analysis requires measurements using area or distance, *st_set_crs()* is not appropriate and *st_transform()* should be used instead. Decide on the appropriate CRS before doing projection transformation.

```{r}
preschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, crs=3414)
```

Updated contents of preschool data

```{r}
st_geometry(preschool3414)
```

# Working with aspatial data

Importing csv data

```{r}
listings <- st_read("data/aspatial/listings.csv")
```

Verify the data has been imported correctly

```{r}
#| eval: false
list(listings)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
as_tibble(listings)
```

Converting listings Data Frame into a simple feature Data Frame:

```{r}
listings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, 
                       coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                       crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

The <code>listings</code> Data Frame contains 4,252 rows and 15 columns as seen below.

```{r}
glimpse(listings_sf)
```

# Geoprocessing

## Buffering

Context: A governmental organisation wants to retrofit and upgrade an existing cycling path that requires 5 meters of reserved land on either side of the current cycling path. How can we find out the total land area needed to be acquired?

Solution:

1.  Using a buffer of 5 meters around the cycling paths

```{r}
buffer_cycling <- st_buffer(cyclingpath, dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)
```

2.  Calculate the area of the buffers

```{r}
buffer_cycling$AREA <- st_area(buffer_cycling)
```

3.  Therefore, the total area needed would be the sum of areas of buffers

```{r}
sum(buffer_cycling$AREA)
```

## Point-in-polygon count

Context: How can we find out the number of pre-schools in each planning subzone?

Solution: 1. Identify the count of pre-schools in each subzone

```{r}
mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`<- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))
```

2.  Check summary statistics of newly derived 'PreSch Count' field

```{r}
summary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)
```

3.  Listing the planning subzone with the highest number of pre-schools

```{r}
top_n(mpsz3414, 1, `PreSch Count`)
```

Tampines East subzone has the most number of pre-schools.

4.  Computing the density of pre-schools by planning subzone

First, derive the area of each planning subzone:

```{r}
mpsz3414$Area <- mpsz3414 %>% st_area()
```

```{r}
mpsz3414 <- mpsz3414 %>%
  mutate(`PreSch Density` = `PreSch Count`/Area * 1000000)
```

# Exploratary Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA consists of initial analysis and findings done to understand major trends in the data and visualising it as a whole. The package **ggplot2** is used to give a quick overview of the dataset.

## Histogram

Shows distribution of <code>PreSch Density</code> using conventional package from R Graphics.

```{r}
hist(mpsz3414$`PreSch Density`)
```

Appropriate histogram visualisation using **ggplot2**.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpsz3414, 
       aes(x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=20, color="black",  fill="light blue") +
  labs(title = "Are pre-school even distributed in Singapore?",
       subtitle= "There are many planning sub-zones with a single pre-school, on the other hand, \nthere are two planning sub-zones with at least 20 pre-schools",
      x = "Pre-school density (per km sq)",
      y = "Frequency")
```

## Scatterplot

Shows the relationship between <code>PreSch Density</code> and <code>PreSch Count</code>.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpsz3414, 
       aes(y = `PreSch Count`,  x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+
  geom_point(color="black", fill="light blue") +
  xlim(0, 40) +
  ylim(0, 40) +
  labs(title = "",
      x = "Pre-school density (per km sq)",
      y = "Pre-school count")
```
